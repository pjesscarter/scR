Description: We provide a suite of tools for estimating the sample complexity of a chosen model through theoretical bounds and simulation. The package incorporates methods for estimating the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension (VCD) of a chosen algorithm, which can be used to estimate its sample complexity. Alternatively, we provide simulation methods to estimate sample complexity directly. For more details, see Carter, P & Choi, D (2024).
